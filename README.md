Team Roles

Business analyst (BA):
-Understands customer’s business processes
-Translates customer business needs into requirements
A business analyst dives deep into a customer’s workflows and analyzes stakeholder 
feedback to help a client formulate what their wants look like and align a customer's 
vision with what a development team is producing. They translate an abstract product 
idea into a set of tangible requirements.

Product owner (PO):
-Holds responsibility for a product vision and evolution
-Makes sure the final product meets customer requirements
Holding more responsibility for a product’s success than any other development 
team member, a product owner is a decision-maker. Balancing both business needs 
and market trends, they define a business strategy, shape up the product vision, 
make sure it satisfies customer needs, and manage a product backlog.

Project manager (PM):
-Makes sure a product or its part is delivered on time and within budget
-Manages and motivates the software development team
In sequential models, a project manager is responsible for distributing tasks across 
team members, planning work activities, and updating project status.

UI/UX designer:
-Transforms a product vision into user-friendly designs.
-Creates user journeys for the best user experience and highest conversion rates
A UI designer devises intuitive, easy-to-use, and eye-pleasing interfaces for a 
product, while the UX part stands for thinking out an entire journey of a user’s 
interaction with a product. A UX designer is thus involved in such activities as user 
research, persona development, information architecture design, wireframing, prototyping, and more.

Software architect:
-Designs a high-level software architecture
-Selects appropriate tools and platforms to implement the product vision
-Sets up code quality standards and performs code reviews
An architect is an expert-level software engineer who makes executive software 
design decisions on behalf of an app development team.


Software developer:
-Engineers and stabilizes the product
-Solves any technical problems emerging during the development lifecycle
A software developer does the actual job and codes an application. And just like an 
app features a front end and a back end, there are front-end and back-end developers.


Quality assurance (QA) engineer:
-Makes sure an application performs according to requirements
-Spots functional and non-functional defects
The job of a quality assurance engineer is to verify whether an application meets the 
requirements both functional and non-functional. Functional requirements define 
what an application should do, while non-functional requirements specify how it 
should do that.

Test automation engineer:
-Designs a test automation ecosystem
-Writes and maintains test scripts for automated testing
A test automation engineer is there to help you test faster and better. To enable 
that, they develop test automation scripts—small programs that provide reliable and 
continuous feedback on application quality without any human involvement.


DevOps engineer:
-Facilitates cooperation between development and operations teams
-Builds continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for faster delivery
Even in Agile environments, development and operations teams can be siloed. 
DevOps engineers serve as a link between the two teams, unifying and automating 
the software delivery process and helping strike a balance between introducing 
changes quickly and keeping an application stable.

API Security

1Authentication
Description: Verifies the identity of users or systems attempting to access the project. Common methods include:
Password-based authentication with strong hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) using factors like SMS codes, authenticator apps, or biometrics.
OAuth/OpenID Connect for third-party logins (e.g., Google, Facebook).
Single Sign-On (SSO) for seamless access across multiple services.
Implementation: Use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS), enforce strong password policies, 
and store credentials securely (hashed and salted). Implement session management with 
short-lived tokens (e.g., JWTs) and secure cookies.

Authorization
Description: Controls what authenticated users or systems can do by defining access levels.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Assigns permissions based on user roles (e.g., admin, user).
Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC): Uses attributes (e.g., location, time) for granular access control.
Principle of Least Privilege: Grants only the minimum permissions necessary.
Implementation: Use middleware to enforce access controls, validate user permissions per request, 
and regularly audit access policies.

Rate Limiting 
Description: Restricts the number of requests a user or IP can make in a given timeframe to prevent abuse (e.g., DDoS attacks, brute-force attempts).
-Token bucket or leaky bucket algorithms to cap requests (e.g., 100 requests/hour per user).
-API-specific limits to protect endpoints (e.g., login attempts).
Implementation: Deploy rate-limiting middleware (e.g., in NGINX, API gateways) and monitor traffic for anomalies.

Encryption
Description: Protects data in transit and at rest.
In Transit: Use TLS/SSL for secure communication (e.g., HTTPS, WSS).
At Rest: Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., user PII, payment details) using AES-256 or similar standards.
Key management with secure vaults (e.g., AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault).
Implementation: Enforce TLS 1.3, use strong ciphers, and regularly rotate encryption keys.

Input Validation and Sanitization
Description: Prevents injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) by validating and sanitizing user inputs.
-Use allowlists for acceptable inputs.
-Escape or sanitize inputs before processing (e.g., using libraries like DOMPurify for web apps).
Implementation: Apply validation at both client and server sides, and use prepared statements for database queries.

Logging and Monitoring
Description: Tracks system activity to detect and respond to security incidents.
-Log access attempts, errors, and suspicious activities without storing sensitive data (e.g., passwords).
-Use intrusion detection systems (IDS) and security information and event management (SIEM) tools.
Implementation: Centralize logs (e.g., ELK stack), set up alerts for anomalies, and conduct regular audits.

Secure APIs and Endpoints
Description: Protects APIs from unauthorized access and abuse.
-Use API keys, OAuth tokens, or mutual TLS for authentication.
-Implement CORS policies to restrict cross-origin requests.
-Validate and sanitize API inputs/outputs.
Implementation: Use API gateways (e.g., AWS API Gateway) and enforce versioning for backward compatibility.

Why Security is Crucial for Key Areas:
1.Protecting User Data
Why: User data (e.g., PII, passwords) is a prime target for attackers. Breaches can lead to identity 
theft, financial loss, and reputational damage.
Security Measures: Encryption (at rest and in transit), strong authentication (MFA), and authorization (RBAC/ABAC) ensure only authorized users access sensitive data. Input validation prevents injection attacks that could expose data.

2.Securing Payments
Why: Payment systems handle sensitive financial information (e.g., credit card details). 
Breaches can result in financial fraud, legal liabilities, and loss of customer trust.
Security Measures: Use PCI DSS-compliant payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal), encrypt 
payment data, and implement tokenization to avoid storing raw card details. Rate limiting 
and monitoring prevent brute-force attacks on payment endpoints.

3.Preventing Unauthorized Access
Why: Unauthorized access can lead to data tampering, service disruption, or system compromise. 
It undermines trust and may violate regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
Security Measures: Strong authentication (MFA, SSO), authorization (least privilege), and secure 
APIs ensure only legitimate users access resources. Logging and monitoring detect unauthorized attempts.

4.Maintaining System Integrity
Why: Compromised systems can disrupt operations, alter data, or serve malicious content, affecting reliability 
and user safety.
Security Measures: Regular patching, vulnerability scanning, and secure coding practices (e.g., input validation) 
prevent exploits. Rate limiting and monitoring mitigate denial-of-service risks.

5.Ensuring Regulatory Compliance
Why: Non-compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) can lead to hefty fines and legal consequences.
Security Measures: Encryption, access controls, and audit logs ensure compliance with data protection laws. 
Regular security assessments verify adherence to standards.


CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD pipelines are a series of automated steps that allow development teams to deliver 
software frequently and reliably. CI stands for Continuous Integration, and CD stands for 
Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment.

Why CI/CD Pipelines are Important for a Project:

CI/CD pipelines are crucial for a project due to several key benefits:

Faster Release Cycles: Automation streamlines the entire development process, from code commit 
to deployment, significantly reducing the time it takes to get new features and bug fixes to users.
Improved Code Quality: Continuous integration means that code changes are frequently merged into a 
central repository and automatically tested. This early detection of integration issues and bugs 
leads to higher code quality.
Reduced Risk: Automated testing and deployment minimize the chances of human error during the release
 process, leading to more stable and reliable software.
Increased Efficiency and Productivity: Developers can focus on writing code rather than manual tasks, as 
the pipeline handles building, testing, and deploying. This boosts overall team productivity.
Better Collaboration: CI/CD fosters a culture of collaboration as developers integrate their code more frequently, 
leading to fewer merge conflicts and a more unified codebase.
Faster Feedback Loops: Issues are identified and addressed quickly, allowing for rapid iteration and 
improvement based on feedback.
Scalability: CI/CD pipelines can be scaled to handle complex projects and growing teams, ensuring consistent 
delivery regardless of project size.

Tools that Could Be Used for CI/CD Pipelines:
A variety of tools are used in CI/CD pipelines, often in combination:
