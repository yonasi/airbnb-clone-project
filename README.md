Team Roles

Business analyst (BA):
-Understands customer’s business processes
-Translates customer business needs into requirements
A business analyst dives deep into a customer’s workflows and analyzes stakeholder 
feedback to help a client formulate what their wants look like and align a customer's 
vision with what a development team is producing. They translate an abstract product 
idea into a set of tangible requirements.

Product owner (PO):
-Holds responsibility for a product vision and evolution
-Makes sure the final product meets customer requirements
Holding more responsibility for a product’s success than any other development 
team member, a product owner is a decision-maker. Balancing both business needs 
and market trends, they define a business strategy, shape up the product vision, 
make sure it satisfies customer needs, and manage a product backlog.

Project manager (PM):
-Makes sure a product or its part is delivered on time and within budget
-Manages and motivates the software development team
In sequential models, a project manager is responsible for distributing tasks across 
team members, planning work activities, and updating project status.

UI/UX designer:
-Transforms a product vision into user-friendly designs.
-Creates user journeys for the best user experience and highest conversion rates
A UI designer devises intuitive, easy-to-use, and eye-pleasing interfaces for a 
product, while the UX part stands for thinking out an entire journey of a user’s 
interaction with a product. A UX designer is thus involved in such activities as user 
research, persona development, information architecture design, wireframing, prototyping, and more.

Software architect:
-Designs a high-level software architecture
-Selects appropriate tools and platforms to implement the product vision
-Sets up code quality standards and performs code reviews
An architect is an expert-level software engineer who makes executive software 
design decisions on behalf of an app development team.


Software developer:
-Engineers and stabilizes the product
-Solves any technical problems emerging during the development lifecycle
A software developer does the actual job and codes an application. And just like an 
app features a front end and a back end, there are front-end and back-end developers.


Quality assurance (QA) engineer:
-Makes sure an application performs according to requirements
-Spots functional and non-functional defects
The job of a quality assurance engineer is to verify whether an application meets the 
requirements both functional and non-functional. Functional requirements define 
what an application should do, while non-functional requirements specify how it 
should do that.

Test automation engineer:
-Designs a test automation ecosystem
-Writes and maintains test scripts for automated testing
A test automation engineer is there to help you test faster and better. To enable 
that, they develop test automation scripts—small programs that provide reliable and 
continuous feedback on application quality without any human involvement.


DevOps engineer:
-Facilitates cooperation between development and operations teams
-Builds continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for faster delivery
Even in Agile environments, development and operations teams can be siloed. 
DevOps engineers serve as a link between the two teams, unifying and automating 
the software delivery process and helping strike a balance between introducing 
changes quickly and keeping an application stable.
